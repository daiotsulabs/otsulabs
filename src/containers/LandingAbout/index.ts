    question: 'Do you produce 2D or 3D animations?',
    answer: [
      'Both. We come from a traditional 2D school of animation where every single frame is drawn frame by frame. But modern-day tech allows us to seamlessly combine 3D rendering with 2D hand-drawing techniques to create something truly impactful. It\'s kinda like a collaboration between a software and an artist.',
      'But at the end of the day, our main goal is to harmonize with a brand\'s visual identity and fulfill the specific requirements of each project. So whether you prefer the never-boring charm of hand-drawn techniques or a contemporary spin on traditional animation, we will deliver.'
